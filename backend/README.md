# SF Curb Ramp Backend

This folder powers the brains of the SF Curb Ramp project. It handles data processing, serves the frontend, and ensures everything runs like clockwork.

## What's Inside
- **`Map_App.py`:** The entry point of the Flask application.
- **`requirements.txt`:** All the Python dependencies you'll need. (Install them with `pip install -r requirements.txt`—you’ll feel like a hacker.)
- **`utils/`:** 
  - `MapProject.py`: Contains all the mapping.
- **Data:**
  - `Curb_Ramps.csv`: The main dataset—basically the foundation of everything.


## How It Works
1. Start the Flask server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
