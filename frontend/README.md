# SF Curb Ramp Frontend
This folder contains all the visual and interactive elements of the SF Curb Ramp project, designed to make accessibility mapping as intuitive as possible.

- **HTML:** 
  - `index.html`: The welcoming homepage with a clean design.
  - `search.html`: The search page where you can locate curb ramps.
  - `about.html`: Learn about the project and its mission.
  - `legend.html`: Understand the map markers and what they represent.
- **CSS:**
  - `style.css`: Styling for the homepage.
  - `search-style.css`: Styling for the search page.
  - `about-style.css`: Styling for the about page.
- **Images:**
  - `logo.png`: Because every project needs a shiny logo.
  - `streetsf.jpeg`: A snapshot of San Francisco's streets.
  - `bridge.jpeg`: The iconic bridge—because we’re keeping it classy.

## How It Works
1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser (or let the Flask backend serve it—magic happens there).
2. Navigate through the pages using the menu in the top-right corner.
3. Explore the interactive map, search for curb ramps, or learn more about the project.
